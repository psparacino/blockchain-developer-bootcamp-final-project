# Decentralized Audio Player

on Kovan.  Need kEth to run.

A decentralized audio player that charges a micropayment per stream.  Buying the album enables unlimited plays.

Further features could include a Contract for every artist and micropayments/album purchases automatically split between artist and platform on txn.  Also some sort of bundling/micropayment channel would make more sense to actually use this to cut down on the number of txns.
